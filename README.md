# greateds-conversion
GreatEd conversion source code. Based on doppelganger's disassembly

# Compile
Just extract CHR data from original ROM and place it with name 'chr.bin' into the src directory.  
To compile sources just run build.bat or BuildROMWithSymbols.bat to compile with symbols (*.nl files)  

# GreatEd
To open result ROM in GreatEd you shall compile ROM with symbols and its names must match with ROM name.  
For example: if ROM named as 'smb.nes' then symbols files must have names 'smb.nes.0.nl', 'smb.nes.1.nl'... and so on.
